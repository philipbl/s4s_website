  Air Quality: Science for Solutions is an annual conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain West. It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham Entrepreneurship & Energy Research Center in 2015.

  The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate researchers of various disciplines from each other, from professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working towards the development of solutions.
